This app is a project for the Make It Material course of Udacity's 
Android Developer Nanodegree program.  The students were given starter code,
which needed a lot of love.  The purpose of the project was to turn the
buggy, ugly starter code into well-funtioning, visually-appealing
app by applying Material Design principles and good development practices.

Features:

1) Material Design
  a) activity transitions
  b) background image parallax scrolling effects
  c) Custom scrolling view behavior
    i) dynamically controlls appearance of app logo on when the toolbar collapses
    ii) dynamically controlls article content overlap with background image independent of
        image size
2) Streamlined app by removing redundant code
